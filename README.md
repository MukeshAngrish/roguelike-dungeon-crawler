It is a truth universally acknowledged that every now and again
a situation arises that defies explanation. And so it was with your
ascension to the Presidency of the United States.

While preparing for a press conference, you are warned of an
impending alien invasion. Just as you are informed, the invasion
begins, spearheaded by the alien warlord The Boss, who captures
the entire cabinet, including you.

You realize that you are trapped inside a randomized simulation.
You can collect weapons and health to gain XP. Kill all the villains
to weakens the simulation and gain mega XP. Without any villains
left The Boss will be forced to face you.

It's time to save the world!
