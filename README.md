## A Roguelike Dungeon Crawler : 2D Game build with React

### Introduction
It is a truth universally acknowledged that every now and again
a situation arises that defies explanation. And so it was with your
ascension to the Presidency of the United States.

While preparing for a press conference, you are warned of an
impending alien invasion. Just as you are informed, the invasion
begins, spearheaded by the alien warlord The Boss, who captures
the entire cabinet, including you.

You realize that you are trapped inside a randomized simulation.
You can collect weapons and health to gain XP. Kill all the villains
to weakens the simulation and gain mega XP. Without any villains
left The Boss will be forced to face you.

It's time to save the world!

### Instructions

1. You have health, a level, and a weapon. You can pick up a better weapon and health items.
2. All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.
3. You can move throughout a map, discovering items.
4. You can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but you can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.
5. Much of the map is hidden. When you take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from you are revealed.
6. The visible area in the map can be toggled by pressing T.
7. When you beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and you get XP, which eventually increases your level.
8. When you fight an enemy, you take turns damaging each other until one of you loses. You do damage based off of your level and your weapon. The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.
9. When you find and beat the boss, you win.
10. You can restart with a random map by pressing R.
